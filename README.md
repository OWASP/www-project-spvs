## **Description of SPVS**

The **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** is a comprehensive, security-focused framework designed to safeguard the **entire software delivery pipeline** — from **planning and development** through **integration, release, and ongoing operations**.

SPVS provides **structured, actionable guidance** for mitigating risks associated with **code, artifacts, and operational environments**, helping organizations build **secure-by-design pipelines**. It introduces a **multi-tiered maturity model**, enabling teams to start with foundational security controls and progressively advance toward **best-in-class DevSecOps practices**.

Built around the five core stages — **Plan, Develop, Integrate (CI*)**, **Release (CD*)**, and **Operate** — SPVS ensures that security is **embedded, automated, and continuously validated** at every phase of the software lifecycle. The framework is both **comprehensive and adaptable**, making it effective across diverse **cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments**, and compatible with varied methodologies such as **Agile, DevOps, and Platform Engineering**.

Here’s the **updated Markdown version** of your **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** — rewritten to align with the updated SPVS framework, stages, and purpose we’ve discussed. It maintains your original structure (Scope, Audience, Principles) but enhances clarity, flow, and consistency with the SPVS model.

## **Scope**

The **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** establishes a comprehensive framework for **embedding and verifying security across all stages of the software delivery pipeline** — from **planning and development** to **integration, release, and operations**.

Its scope includes the **implementation and validation of multilayered security controls** that address risks associated with **code, artifacts, and build environments** throughout the entire pipeline lifecycle. The framework introduces a **tiered control model**, enabling organizations to progressively mature their security posture — from foundational safeguards to advanced, automated protections.

SPVS is adaptable to diverse development environments and methodologies, including **Agile, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Platform Engineering**, and applies equally across **multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-premises infrastructures**. It provides comprehensive coverage of:

* **Secure code management** and **artifact integrity**
* **Automated security checks** and **validation within CI/CD pipelines**
* **Compliance monitoring and governance**
* **Incident response and operational resilience**

By standardizing how organizations integrate and verify security across the **Plan, Develop, Integrate (CI*)**, **Release (CD*)**, and **Operate** stages, SPVS serves as an essential resource for improving pipeline security maturity and **defending against evolving threats in the software supply chain**.
