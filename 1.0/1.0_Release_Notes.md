# 1.0 RELEASE

# 🚀 Release Announcement: SPVS 1.0 🚀

We’re thrilled to announce the official release of SPVS (Secure Pipeline Validation Standard) 1.0! 🎉

This release marks a major milestone in our journey to define a standard that helps bring clarity, consistency, and confidence to securing pipelines.

Over the past months, we’ve had our share of intense debates (yes, some of them were about YAML indentation 😅), but the result is a standard we’re proud to share with the community.

## 👉 Why This Matters

SPVS 1.0 provides a clear direction for how we believe pipelines can be validated and secured—turning best practices into practical, actionable guidance.

But this isn’t the finish line. It’s the foundation. We see SPVS as a living standard that will grow stronger with community feedback, real-world adoption, and lessons learned in the field.
