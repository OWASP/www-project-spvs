## SPVS Overview:

The **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** is a comprehensive framework that provides a robust set of **security controls** and **best practices** for **software engineers, DevOps/DevSecOps teams, and security professionals.** It is designed to assess, enhance, and standardize the security maturity of software delivery pipelines across all stages — **Plan, Develop, Integrate, Release, and Operate**.

**SPV**S** focuses on managing and mitigating risks associated with **code, artifacts, and operational environments throughout the pipeline lifecycle** — from **inception to ongoing operations.** By embedding security at every phase, SPVS ensures continuous alignment with **compliance standards, artifact integrity,** and **secure delivery practices, fostering a culture of proactive security and operational resilience** within modern DevSecOps ecosystems.

### **Summary**

The **SPVS** serves as a **critical enabler** for organizations aiming to strengthen their **software pipeline security**.
It transforms traditional DevOps pipelines into **secure-by-design, continuously validated systems**, providing a **scalable, adaptable, and measurable path** toward sustained security maturity.


## **Description of SPVS**

The **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** is a comprehensive, security-focused framework designed to safeguard the **entire software delivery pipeline** — from **planning and development** through **integration, release, and ongoing operations**.

SPVS provides **structured, actionable guidance** for mitigating risks associated with **code, artifacts, and operational environments**, helping organizations build **secure-by-design pipelines**. It introduces a **multi-tiered maturity model**, enabling teams to start with foundational security controls and progressively advance toward **best-in-class DevSecOps practices**.

Built around the five core stages — **Plan, Develop, Integrate (CI*)**, **Release (CD*)**, and **Operate** — SPVS ensures that security is **embedded, automated, and continuously validated** at every phase of the software lifecycle. The framework is both **comprehensive and adaptable**, making it effective across diverse **cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments**, and compatible with varied methodologies such as **Agile, DevOps, and Platform Engineering**.


## **Key Objective**

To establish a **standardized, measurable, and adaptable security framework** that enables organizations to **design, implement, and maintain secure software pipelines** across all stages of the development and deployment lifecycle.
SPVS ensures continuous **risk management**, **compliance alignment**, and **operational resilience**, fostering a **security-first culture** throughout the software delivery process.


## **Goal**

To provide a **robust suite of controls and best practices** that:

* **Reduces the risk of attacks** and vulnerabilities across software pipelines.
* **Improves artifact integrity**, build environment protection, and release assurance.
* **Automates security validation and compliance** within CI/CD processes.
* **Elevates security maturity** progressively through the SPVS stages.

Ultimately, SPVS empowers organizations to deliver **secure, reliable, and compliant software** — efficiently and at scale.

## **Key Aspects of the SPVS Guide**

The **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** provides a structured, adaptable, and actionable framework that integrates security across all stages of the software pipeline — **Plan, Develop, Integrate, Release, and Operate**.

### **1. Multilevel Control Framework**

SPVS introduces a **tiered control structure** that aligns with organizational maturity levels.

* Each control maps to specific pipeline stages and corresponding security objectives.
* Enables teams to **adopt baseline controls** early and **progress toward advanced practices** as maturity increases.
* Supports alignment with frameworks such as **CIS Benchmarks**, **OWASP ASVS**, and **cloud provider Well-Architected Frameworks**.

### **2. Progressive Implementation Pathway**

Provides a **stage-by-stage roadmap** for building secure pipelines.

* Guides teams from foundational security principles in **Plan** and **Develop**, to advanced controls in **Integrate**, **Release**, and **Operate**.
* Encourages **continuous improvement**, allowing incremental security adoption without disrupting delivery velocity.
* Embeds **feedback loops** and **threat-informed iteration** for sustained enhancement.

### **3. Customizable and Adaptable Controls**

Delivers **flexible, environment-agnostic controls** tailored to diverse software delivery ecosystems.

* Supports **multi-cloud**, **hybrid**, and **on-premises** architectures.
* Adaptable to varied methodologies — **Agile, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Platform Engineering**.
* Ensures **context-aware security integration** across tooling (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Azure DevOps).

### **4. Comprehensive Pipeline Coverage**

Covers the **end-to-end software lifecycle**, embedding security throughout.

* Focus areas include **secure code management**, **artifact integrity**, **build environment protection**, and **automated validation** within CI/CD.
* Integrates **compliance monitoring**, **change control**, **incident response**, and **operational resilience**.
* Reinforces **visibility and traceability** across all SPVS stages to ensure accountability and auditability.

### **5. Actionable and Dynamic Resource**

Acts as a **living framework** designed for **continuous evolution and measurable improvement**.

* Offers **clear, actionable controls** that drive tangible security outcomes.
* Promotes **automation**, **real-time assessment**, and **data-driven decision-making** for pipeline hardening.
* Enables organizations of all sizes to **evaluate, benchmark, and elevate** their software pipeline security posture.

## **SPVS Stages**

The **Secure Pipeline Verification Standard (SPVS)** enhances traditional **DevSecOps** and **DevOps** practices by embedding security principles into every phase of the software delivery lifecycle.

### **1. Plan**

Define scope, objectives, and security requirements for each iteration.

* Assess risks, establish baselines, and align with business and compliance goals.
* Incorporate **feedback loops**, **postmortems**, **threat modeling**, and **lessons learned**.
* Ensure continuous improvement in product quality and security posture.

### **2. Develop**

Build security into the code from the start.

* Follow **secure coding standards** and perform **continuous code reviews**.
* Integrate **automated vulnerability detection** tools during development.
* Address issues early to reduce remediation costs and risk.

### **3. Integrate (CI*)**

Securely integrate new code into the main codebase.

* Enforce **security checkpoints** before deployment.
* Perform **automated validation**, **artifact integrity checks**, and **environment hardening**.
* Use **structured, repeatable security tests** and **compliance-aligned scans** to detect vulnerabilities early.

### **4. Release (CD*)**

Ensure production-ready, secure, and compliant deployments.

* Conduct **final security validations**, **compliance checks**, and **approvals**.
* Use **automated, auditable pipelines** for minimal-risk releases.
* Emphasize **artifact integrity**, **change control**, and **secure rollout strategies**.

### **5. Operate**

Maintain and protect production environments.

* Implement **continuous monitoring**, **incident response**, and **patch management**.
* Enforce **access control** and **operational resilience**.
* Leverage **real-time visibility** and **anomaly detection** to ensure ongoing compliance and reliability.
